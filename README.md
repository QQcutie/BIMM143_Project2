Scientific Question: Would the storage protein, an allergen, in peanut induce allergenic cross-reactive with pistachio as cashew and pistachio have high cross-reaticity for one another?

Information of the protein sequences were found from the NCBI website
Arachis hypogaea (peanut)
Arachis hypogaea main allergen Ara h1 mRNA, complete cds

crystal structure: https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3s7i

Pistacia vera (pistachio)
Pistacia vera Pis v 1 allergen 2S albumin mRNA, complete cds

Anacardium occidentale (cashew)
Anacardium occidentale allergen Ana o 2 mRNA, partial cds
